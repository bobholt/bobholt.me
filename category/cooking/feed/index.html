		<description><![CDATA[We got a bunch of Toulouse sausage from M.F. Dulock as part of our reward for supporting their Indigogo campaign. Now are sausages processed? Sure, but Dulock is a traditional tail-to-snout butcher. You can see the animal the cuts come from, and I trust the sausage as much as if I had bought the meat [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, everybody. It&#8217;s been a while. Between taking care of Malcolm, and the stifling heat of summer (we don&#8217;t have central air, so the kitchen gets REALLY hot), we didn&#8217;t do much cooking for ourselves over the last few months (Malcolm still gets home-cooked veggies and grains for every meal). At least nothing really new [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think of fiddleheads as a quintessentially New England ingredient, and it seems these young fronds of the ostrich fern aren&#8217;t generally eaten outside of the North Atlantic region of the US and Canada. If you don&#8217;t have fiddleheads near you, you can certainly use asparagus. They have a similar light vegetable flavor. This is [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tamar Adler&#8217;s&#160;An Everlasting Meal: Cooking with Economy and Grace&#160;isn&#8217;t really a cookbook, though it has recipes and one could easily learn how to make several dozen meals by reading it intently. Nor is it a memoir, though it certainly has a few nostalgic, almost wistful, moments. It is Adler&#8217;s story of the art and love [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mia tried her hand at homemade rye crackers a couple of weeks ago. We eat a lot of&#160;knäckebröd&#160;(often with sardines or gravlax), and it would make sense if we could make something similar at home. These make a slightly denser and buttery—but still crisp—cracker. Ingredients 1 cup whole rye flour 1 cup whole wheat flour [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mia and I came home with a little pasta from our pasta-making class, so I whipped together a quick dinner for us the next day using the handmade pasta and the easiest of the sauces we learned. You can make this with either fresh or dried pasta. The only real difference is that you&#8217;re probably [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mia expressed an interest in learning how to make homemade pasta leading up to her birthday in January. Doting husband I am, I immediately bought her the pasta roller/cutter attachments for our KitchenAid and signed us up for a 4-hour combo sauce and pasta-making class at our local boutique grocery: Dave&#8217;s Fresh Pasta.

		<description><![CDATA[Our Whole Foods trip last week yielded four lamb chops. I had never made them, and we were curious about how much Mia would like them. This, like probably every recipe I&#8217;ll ever post here, uses few ingredients and is incredibly easy. I think that when you&#8217;re making food for every day, it should be [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#8217;s an experiment. We&#8217;ll post selections from a previous store register receipt to show what we bought in a given trip: perhaps with commentary, perhaps without. I&#8217;m calling it a &#8220;reverse shopping list,&#8221; because it shows what we actually bought, not what we planned to buy. It should help keep us mindful of the things [&#8230;]]]></description>

This one&#8217;s just as simple as the rest, and I think all baby food must be, or you&#8217;re going to say &#8220;Screw it,&#8221; and go get 300 jars of Gerber at Costco. Blanch some frozen peas, pulverize them in the food processor, and you&#8217;re done. The frozen peas [&#8230;]]]></description>
